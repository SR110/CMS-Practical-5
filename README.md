I made 6 edits to make my WordPress Site better. I made the edits to the style.css file.
First, I duplicated the parent theme and then worked on the changes in the copied file, leaving the child theme untouched.

1st change:      
Before: On Hovering, there was no change.     
After: On Hovering, colour changes from original beige to orange.   

2nd change:     
Before: Opacity changes from 100% to 90% on hovering and colour was same (teal).    
After: Opacity changes from 100% to 75% on hovering and colour changes from teal to light green.     

3rd change:     
Before: On hovering, the menu items were only underlined.    
After: Now, on hovering, you would see the orange colour with the underline, making it more prominent and obvious.    

4th change:    
Before: On hovering, the menu items were only underlined.      
After: After changes, there is an addition of the box shadow feature which makes the menu items more appealing and users will be prompted to click the menu items.     

5th change:   
Before: Follows the greyscale and although the code makes the text more readable and aesthetically pleasing, the quality of the content can be improved upon.     
After: After the changes, the quality of the content has increased.   

6th change:     
Before: The margin and width could be better managed.    
After: After the changes, there is more white space at the sides of the Contact Us Page.     

# URLs
No URLs were used for this week's practical as such. But, we were told to follow the steps from the PPT shared during class to connect Visual Studio Code to WordPress and allow the changes in code to be transferred.

# Estimated Hours 
I spent around a day on this practical.

# Content Insights 
This practical was not easy as it required you to delve deep into understanding the CSS of an already existing theme, which is not the basic CSS that we have been taught before. This allowed me to play around a little with the code and find ways to make the website better. After much trial and error, I have managed to complete this practical, making the six changes listed above. I tried making the website's links more interesting so that they catch the user's attention and to add the colour to the site. Then, I played with the opacity of buttons. I even made the colour of the button change when hovered upon. Besides these, I added the box shadow effect to the menu to add dimension and improve the aesthetics of the website. Then, I tried making the quality of content better and lastly, I tried playing with white space.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Since the CSS used was very advanced, it better prepared me for work, both technically and otherwise. It taught me to not be afraid of trying, taking risk and experimenting. At the same time, my fundamentals of CSS were put to test and it was a fun experience. After having done this, I am confident that I can conquer complex problems at work and I would not be scared to try things that appear to be intimidating.
